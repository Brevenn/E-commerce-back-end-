# **Welcome to my E-commerce Store!**

#

### *Description:*

- **Here you can find back-end code for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database in place. The user will have the ability to add products, product price tags and product categories!**

#

### *Usage:*

- **To initialize and start the application you will navigate to the integrated command-terminal in the *"Develop"* folder.**
- **Run *"npm i"* to install the neccesary dependencies and packages to run the application.**
- **Once the npm packages are installed you can either run *"npm start"* or *"node server.js"* to intialize the files and begin running the server on *"localhost:3001"*.**
- **All routes have been tested and should allow the user to add, pull and delete using the working API.**
